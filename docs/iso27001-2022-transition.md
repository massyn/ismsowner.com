# ISO 27001:2022 Transition Guide

## Overview

ISO 27001:2022 was published in October 2022, replacing ISO 27001:2013. Organizations certified under the 2013 version have until **October 31, 2025** to transition to the new standard.

## Key Changes in ISO 27001:2022

**ISO 27001:2022:**
- 4 control themes
- 93 total controls  
- Business-focused organization

### New Four-Theme Structure

**A.5 - Organizational Controls (37 controls)**

## New Controls in 2022

The 2022 version introduces 11 completely new controls addressing modern security challenges:

- **A.5.7** - Threat intelligence
- **A.5.23** - Information security for use of cloud services
- **A.5.30** - ICT readiness for business continuity
- **A.7.4** - Physical security monitoring
- **A.8.9** - Configuration management
- **A.8.10** - Information deletion
- **A.8.11** - Data masking
- **A.8.12** - Data leakage prevention
- **A.8.16** - Monitoring activities
- **A.8.23** - Web filtering
- **A.8.28** - Secure coding

## Transition Planning

### Assessment Phase (Now - Q2 2024)

1. **Gap Analysis**: Compare your current controls against the new 2022 structure
2. **Control Mapping**: Map existing 2013 controls to the new 2022 framework
3. **Risk Assessment**: Identify areas where new controls may be needed

### Implementation Phase (Q3 2024 - Q1 2025)

1. **Update Documentation**: Revise policies, procedures, and [Statement of Applicability](statement-of-applicability.md)
2. **Implement New Controls**: Deploy the 11 new controls relevant to your organization
3. **Training**: Educate staff on the new control structure and requirements

### Certification Phase (Q2 2025 - October 2025)

1. **Internal Audit**: Conduct [internal audits](internal-audit.md) against the 2022 standard
2. **Management Review**: Hold [management review](management-review.md) meetings to assess readiness
3. **External Audit**: Schedule transition audit with your certification body

## Control Mapping Examples

| ISO 27001:2013 | ISO 27001:2022 | Change Type |
|---|---|---|
| A.6.1.1 Information security roles and responsibilities | A.5.2 Information security roles and responsibilities | Renamed/Moved |
| A.12.2.1 Controls against malware | A.8.7 Protection against malware | Renamed/Moved |
| A.9.2.1 User registration and de-registration + A.9.2.6 Removal or adjustment of access rights | A.5.18 Access rights | Merged |
| - | A.8.28 Secure coding | New control |

## Benefits of the 2022 Version

- **Clearer organization**: Four logical themes instead of 14 scattered domains
- **Business alignment**: Less IT-centric, more business-focused language
- **Modern threats**: New controls address cloud, data protection, and current cyber threats
- **Simplified implementation**: Merged controls reduce duplication and complexity

## Common Transition Challenges

1. **Control mapping complexity**: Some 2013 controls have been split or merged
2. **New control implementation**: Organizations may lack capabilities for new technical controls
3. **Documentation overhaul**: Extensive updates to policies and procedures required
4. **Staff training**: Teams need education on the new structure
5. **Timeline pressure**: Limited time until the October 2025 deadline

## Recommendations

- **Start early**: Begin transition planning as soon as possible
- **Focus on gaps**: Prioritize implementing the 11 new controls
- **Use transition period**: Leverage the overlap period for gradual implementation
- **Seek guidance**: Consider professional consultation for complex mappings
- **Test thoroughly**: Conduct comprehensive testing before the final audit

Organizations that proactively plan their transition will find the 2022 standard provides a more logical, business-focused approach to information security management while addressing modern cybersecurity challenges.
